To be honest the one thing that has kept me sane during this insane time is my programming work. I think coding different projects and progressing through obstacles really takes your mind off of the craziness that surrounds you. I truly believe that coding can be a source of relaxation and brings a sense of calm. With the increased amount of freetime I enjoy, I work on other "fun" coding projects that enhance and push my programming limits to the edge. Working from home has actually allowed me to work on coding projects more efficiently and as long as I limit myself to the number of Tik-Toks I watch per day I should complete the coursework on time!
