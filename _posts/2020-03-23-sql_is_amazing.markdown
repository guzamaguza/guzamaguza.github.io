After learning the basics of SQL, I am amazed at how powerful and friendly the language is! Every line that you type makes sense and is extremely intuitive. I read a recent article that described the different types of database system engines and it was amazing to see how many types that exist! The top ones were Oracle, mySQL, Microsoft SQL server, and PostgreSQL. Number 10 on the list was SQLite. It is refreshing to hear that we are learning relevant database management systems and that this course is preparing us for the real world! Combining a knowledge of the inner join, left join, and outer join calls with some basic database information it is exciting to think that information can be pulled up from an extremely large database in just a fraction of a second !
