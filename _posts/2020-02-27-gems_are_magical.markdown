After learning Ruby for a while I have realized that the ability to import gems is the most amazing thing on this earth and saves so much time! Importing libraries with the end goal of extending or modifying functionality allows the developer to focus on what's really important - designing/iterating on their unique application idea. Why reinvent the wheel when an entire RubyGems.org library is available with a quick Google search? You can even use Ruby Gems for testing, for deployment, for uploading files, for security - the possiblities are endless. Whatever you are doing consider doing a quick Ruby Gem search, it could save you hours (or even days) of work!
