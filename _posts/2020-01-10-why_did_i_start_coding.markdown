Quite simply I started to learn programming and software development because I love to build things. I see programming languages as tools and the Flatiron program will provide me the training to use those tools. I love to learn new things and watch my progress and development. I truly enjoy the journey of going from a complete novice to a master of a specific topic. Programming is extremely interesting because it affects every single person's life yet such a small percentage of the population actually knows how to code. There are tons of opportunities related to programming in all sorts of different industries. Having a mechanical engineering degree by background, I felt that learning software development would make me a well rounded engineer. I am excited to see where this journey takes me and I am eager to learn new skills and languages. Stay tuned to hear about my progress!
