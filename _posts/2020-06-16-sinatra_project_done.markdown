As I am just wrapping up my Sinatra project I have to say it has been quite a challenge but a satisfying one at that! There were days where I was stuck on implementing a routing concept and there were days when I was 190% frustrated by a simple CSS concept. In the end it was quite a learning experience and I am confident going into my project review. My project consisted of a program which allows baseball fans to track which Major League stadiums they visit as they go to them! The goal is to not only track games but memories! Once the user visits all the stadiums there is a nice little message that is output to the user in congratulations. I hope baseball fans can use this simple program as I know I certainly will!
