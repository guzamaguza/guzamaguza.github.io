So far the Flatiron Course has been great and I have learned a lot from it. I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge of different languages and especially starting new coding projects. I am excited to visualize something and begin to think about how to do it in code. Currently I am working on a few small projects (including an Android App) and I like it because I am putting everything I learn to the test. I like hobby projects the most because whatever you can dream up you can make (if time allows you)! To anyone reading this: does anyone know good starting coding hackathons out there? Also, does anyone know what the best way to start collaborating on coding projects (via Github)?
