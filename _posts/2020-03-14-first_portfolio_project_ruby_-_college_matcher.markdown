I just completed my first portfolio project and it was a really fun experience. It was really cool to plan it out, set up the classes, and then code and iterate until it was finished. The iteration process was a lot more time consuming than I thought. There were difficult times when some nights I would make very little progress and there were other nights when I would just burn through code. Overall I think the biggest lesson I learned it patience. It will all come together and just enjoy the process along the way.

My coding project is a College Matcher! It matches up several colleges to a student's profile and preferences. It takes into account things like ACT score, whether they prefer a public school or private school, the student population, as well as cost. The program is a CLI that scrapes data from an online website which has a listing of 50 different schools. It is a very useful and quick tool for high school students who are planning on going to university.  

I will have my code review soon and hopefully I can convince the teachers to pass me!
